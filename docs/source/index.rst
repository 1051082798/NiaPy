Nature-inspired algorithms are a very popular tool for solving optimization problems. Since the beginning of their era, numerous variants of [nature-inspired algorithms were developed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4186). To prove their versatility, those were tested in various domains on various applications, especially when they are hybridized, modified or adapted. However, implementation of nature-inspired algorithms is sometimes difficult, complex and tedious task. In order to break this wall, NiaPy is intended for simple and quick use, without spending a time for implementing algorithms from scratch.
